## Introduction and purpose
This project is developed for Java101 which is organized by <a href="https://patika.dev">patika.dev</a>. Aim of the project is to calculate exponent of a number (base) by a function which operates recursively.

## Brief algorithm
Working principle of project depends on calling needed function inside its own. Relevant function takes two parameter: base and exponent. In each function calling, base multiplied with called function but this time exponent is decreased 1. This process continues till, exponent decreased to 0.
